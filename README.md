#Hangman
i will create a hangman game in Python, that is played in the terminal
The Hangman game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting a letter.

#Installation
you need to copy the whole directory named Hangman and then run "python main.py"

#Usage
the first action is to select a letter. Just one and nothing more. You CANNOT use numerical character.

#Visual
it will be your first screen :

----------------------------------------
---------- LET'S PLAY HANGMAN ----------
----------------------------------------

['_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_']

Choose your first letter :
